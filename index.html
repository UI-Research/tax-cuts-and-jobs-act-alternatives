        <p>
        The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, brought about the biggest change to federal tax policy in decades. Despite its massive impact on taxpayers and federal revenue, the TCJA was signed into law less than two months after its formal introduction by Congress. In comparison, the tax reform law passed in 1986 involved two years of debate, testimony, changes, and compromises. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This shortened time frame restricted discussion of the TCJA’s trade-offs and of alternative plans that could lose less revenue or that could distribute tax cuts across income groups more evenly. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To more quickly analyze these trade-offs, we can use the Tax Policy Center’s new ability to repeatedly run its microsimulation model to calculate the change in adjusted revenue for the federal government and the change in after-tax income for different groups. We analyzed over 11,000 plans, each with different changes to tax law elements affected by the TCJA.
        </p>
        <p>
        Below, we walk through how changing provisions of the tax code affects adjusted revenue and after-tax income for people in different income groups in 2018. The Explore section at the bottom of the page allows you to make your own changes to these tax policy parameters and see how those changes affect taxpayers and adjusted revenue. 
        </p>
      </div>
    <div id='sections'>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        First, let’s compare the TCJA with prior law. In 2018, the TCJA produced a 2.21 percent increase in average after-tax income for people of all income groups and a $243 billion decrease in adjusted revenue. The red dashed lines show the TCJA’s effects; the black dashed lines show prior law.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Now we’re looking at over 11,000 alternatives to the TCJA with certain parameters changed in each one. The overall pattern shows that more after-tax income for taxpayers means less revenue for the federal government. Although you might expect this to be a perfectly straight line, it has some variation because, depending on people’s behavior, some plans may produce the same change in after-tax income but more or less adjusted revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
        The effect of changing one parameter can vary widely depending on people’s income and filing status. What tax policy changes have the greatest effect on different ends of the income spectrum?
        </p>
      </section>


      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Let’s start by looking just at taxpayers in the bottom 20 percent (or first quintile) of the income distribution. Four tax policy parameters have the biggest impact on after-tax income for this group: the refundable portion of the child tax credit (CTC), the CTC’s refundability threshold, the standard deduction, and the personal exemption.
        </p>
        <p>
        Jump to the Explore section at the bottom to see how other tax policy parameters affect this group.
        </p>
      </section>


      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Let’s dive into why the CTC plays such a big role in after-tax income for low-income people. This section shows the plans that lead to the most adjusted revenue. Plans further to the right leave people with more after-tax income because they increase the CTC’s refundable portion and lower the refund threshold to zero. Increasing the refundable portion and lowering the threshold expands the CTC to more households.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        The effects of changing elements of the CTC are even more distinct for married taxpayers with kids. The dots are divided into the three refundable portion levels: 50 percent, 70 percent (the TCJA value), and 100 percent. When the refundable portion is higher, taxpayers have more after-tax income. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Within these three groups, we can also see distinct patterns when we change the CTC threshold. Lower thresholds allow people to start accessing the credit at lower incomes. This group represents plans with a CTC threshold of $2,500 (the TCJA value)&hellip;
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        This group represents a CTC threshold of $1,250&hellip;
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
         And this group represents a CTC threshold of $0.
        </p>
      </section>


      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Now let’s zoom out to look at to all taxpayers in the first quintile of the income distribution and explore the effect of changing just the personal exemption. The personal exemption is an amount that all taxpayers, regardless of filing status, can deduct for themselves and their dependents. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In this section, we raise the personal exemption from $0 to $2,050 (midway between the TCJA value and the pre-TCJA value of $4,150). This shifts the dots down because it leads to less adjusted revenue. But it also shifts the dots to the right because it produces more after-tax income for taxpayers in the bottom 20 percent of incomes.
        </p>
        <p>
        This pattern of lower revenue but more after-tax income continues when we increase the personal exemption to $4,150 (the value it would have been had the TCJA not been enacted) and $5,500 (and increase from prior law).
        </p>

        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Altering the standard deduction also has a significant effect on after-tax income for low-income people. The standard deduction changes depending on people’s filing status (single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or head of household). 
        </p>
        <p>
        This chart shows four different standard deductions for married people filing jointly: $13,000 (the pre-TCJA value), $18,500 (midway between the amount under prior law and the TCJA value), $24,000 (the TCJA value), and $26,400 (higher than the TCJA value). 
        </p>
        <p>
        As the standard deduction increases, taxpayers in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution have more after-tax income, but adjusted revenue decreases.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Now let’s turn to people in the top 1 percent of the income distribution. For these high-income people, tax rates are the most important factor affecting after-tax income, and rate brackets vary depending on their adjusted gross income. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For the top bracket, we look at four different tax rates: 37 percent (the TCJA rate), 38.5 percent (about midway between the pre-TCJA and TCJA rates), 39.6 percent (the pre-TCJA rate), and 40.7 percent (10 percent higher than the TCJA rate). The groups in the chart are clustered around these four rates, which move from highest on the left to lowest on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
        The lower tax rates lead to more after-tax income for people in the top 1 percent and less adjusted revenue for the federal government. Other tax parameters don’t have nearly as much effect on after-tax income for these high-income taxpayers. 
        </p>
        <p>Jump to the Explore section at the bottom to see how other tax policy parameters affect this group.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        So what does this all show about the TCJA’s trade-offs? Compared with prior law, many plans would have generated more adjusted revenue than the TCJA while also increasing after-tax income for people in the first quintile.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        But many fewer plans would accomplish this for people in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, because the TCJA disproportionately benefits high-income people.
        </p>
      </section>


      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Let’s look again at plans that benefit after-tax income for lower-income people (or those in the first quintile).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Among tax plans that don’t lose any more revenue than the TCJA, plenty of plans increase after-tax income for people in more than one group. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Here we’re looking at the overlap between plans that benefit the first quintile’s after-tax income and plans that benefit the next-highest income group (or second quintile),&hellip;
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        between the first, second, and third quintiles,&hellip;
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        and between the first, second, third, and fourth quintiles.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        But this trend doesn’t continue when we get to the highest-income taxpayers (the fifth quintile). Among plans that don’t lose more revenue than TCJA, there is no overlap among plans that benefit the fifth quintile and those that benefit any other quintile. In other words, tax plans can’t help the highest-income taxpayers while also helping any other income group. 
        </p>

          All tax plans come with trade-offs for certain groups. Understanding these trade-offs, both in terms of revenue and people’s after-tax income, is critical to creating sound, evidence-based tax policy. In our report, we look at a few alternative plans that would lose less adjusted revenue than the TCJA and more evenly distribute after-tax income. Below, see for yourself how changing tax policy parameters affects adjusted revenue and after-tax income for different groups.

                      We measured the progressivity of school funding as the difference between two weighted averages of each district&rsquo;s per-student revenue: (1) weights are the number of poor students; and (2) weights are the number of nonpoor students. For example, an estimate of $100 would imply that, on average, poor students attend districts that receive $100 more in per-student funding than the districts nonpoor students attend.

                    <p>
                      We calculated our measure for nearly all regular US school districts using data on federal, state, and local revenues from the US Department of Education&rsquo;s Common Core of Data Local Education Agency Finance Survey (F-33). We merged the finance data with district-level poverty data from the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Model-based Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates.  We adjusted districts&rsquo; funding amounts for differences in the costs they face using a measure of the salaries of college graduates who are not teachers in the district&rsquo;s labor market.
