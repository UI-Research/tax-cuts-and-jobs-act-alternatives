        <p>
        The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, brought about the biggest change to federal tax policy in decades. Despite its massive impact on <a href = "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/feature/analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act" target = "_blank">taxpayers</a> and <a href = "https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5053" target = "_blank">federal revenue</a>, the TCJA was signed into law less than two months after its formal introduction by Congress. Because of the magnitude and number of changes the TCJA made to tax law in such a short timeframe, analyzing the effects of alternative choices was impossible. 
        </p>
        <p>
        But now, the Tax Policy Center can rapidly analyze the TCJA&rsquo;s tradeoffs and alternative plans with our new ability to run our <a href = "https://www.urban.org/research/data-methods/data-analysis/quantitative-data-analysis/microsimulation/tax-policy-center-microsimulation-model" target = "_blank">microsimulation model</a> on thousands of separate tax plans. We analyzed over 9,000 plans&mdash;each with different changes to tax law elements affected by the TCJA&mdash;to calculate the change in adjusted revenue for the federal government and the change in taxpayers&rsquo; after-tax income.
        </p>
        <p>
        Below, we walk through how changing provisions of the tax code affects adjusted revenue and after-tax income for people in different income groups in 2018. The Explore section at the bottom of the page allows you to make your own changes to these tax plan parameters and see how those changes affect taxpayers and adjusted revenue.
        </p>
      </div>
    <div id='sections'>
      <section class="step smallStep firstStep">
        <p>
        First, let&rsquo;s compare the TCJA with prior law. In 2018, the TCJA produced a 2.21 percent increase in average after-tax income for people of all income groups and a $243 billion decrease in adjusted revenue. The yellow dashed lines show the TCJA&rsquo;s effects; the black dashed lines show prior law.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Now we&rsquo;re looking at over 9,000 alternatives to the TCJA with certain parameters changed in each one. The overall pattern shows that more after-tax income for taxpayers means less revenue for the federal government. Although you might expect this to be a perfectly straight line, it has some variation because, depending on people&rsquo;s behavior, some plans may produce the same change in after-tax income but more or less adjusted revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
        The effect of changing one parameter can vary widely depending on people&rsquo;s income and filing status. What tax policy changes have the greatest effect on different ends of the income spectrum?
        </p>
      </section>


      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Let&rsquo;s start by looking just at taxpayers in the bottom 20 percent (or first quintile) of the income distribution. Four tax policy parameters have the biggest impact on after-tax income for this group: the refundable portion of the child tax credit (CTC), the CTC&rsquo;s refundability threshold, the standard deduction, and the personal exemption.
        </p>
        <p class = "jumpTo">
        <span data-group = "a" data-income = "1">Jump to the Explore section</span> at the bottom to see how other tax policy parameters affect this group.
        </p>
      </section>


      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Let&rsquo;s dive into why the CTC plays such a big role in after-tax income for low-income people.
        </p>
        <p>
        This section shows the plans that lead to the most adjusted revenue. As we move from left to right across this line, we&rsquo;re only increasing the CTC&rsquo;s refundable portion and lowering the refund threshold to zero. No other tax parameters are changed. Increasing the refundable portion and lowering the threshold expands the CTC to more households and leaves people with more after-tax income.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        The effects of changing elements of the CTC are even more distinct for married taxpayers with kids. The other tax parameters we change have almost no effect on the after-tax income of low-income people with kids. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Here the dots are divided into the three CTC refundable portion levels: 50 percent, 70 percent (the TCJA value), and 100 percent. When the refundable portion is higher, taxpayers have more after-tax income.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Within these three groups, we can also see distinct patterns when we change the CTC threshold. Lower thresholds allow people to start accessing the credit at lower incomes, thereby increasing their after-tax income.
        </p>
        <p>
        This group represents plans with a CTC threshold of $2,500 (the TCJA value),
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        this group represents a CTC threshold of $1,250,
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
         and this group represents a CTC threshold of $0.
        </p>
      </section>


      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Now let&rsquo;s zoom out to look at to all taxpayers in the first quintile of the income distribution and explore the effect of changing just the personal exemption. The personal exemption is an amount that all taxpayers, regardless of filing status, could deduct for themselves and their dependents. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In this chart, the dark blue and light blue dots show the effect of raising the personal exemption from $0 to $2,050 (midway between the TCJA value and the pre-TCJA value of $4,150). This increase in the personal exemption shifts the dots down because it leads to less adjusted revenue. But it also shifts the dots to the right because it produces more after-tax income for taxpayers in the bottom 20 percent of incomes.
        </p>
        <p>
        This pattern of lower revenue but more after-tax income continues when we increase the personal exemption to $4,150 (the value it would have been had the TCJA not been enacted) and $5,500 (and increase from prior law).
        </p>

        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Altering the standard deduction also has a significant effect on after-tax income for low-income people. The standard deduction changes depending on people&rsquo;s filing status (single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or head of household). 
        </p>
        <p>
        This chart shows four different standard deductions for married people filing jointly: $13,000 (the pre-TCJA value), $18,500 (midway between the amount under prior law and the TCJA value), $24,000 (the TCJA value), and $26,400 (higher than the TCJA value). As the standard deduction increases, taxpayers in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution have more after-tax income, but adjusted revenue decreases. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Now let&rsquo;s turn to people in the top 1 percent of the income distribution. For these high-income people, tax rates are the most important factor affecting after-tax income, and rate brackets vary depending on their adjusted gross income. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For the top bracket, we look at four different tax rates: 37 percent (the TCJA rate), 38.5 percent (about midway between the pre-TCJA and TCJA rates), 39.6 percent (the pre-TCJA rate), and 40.7 percent (10 percent higher than the TCJA rate). The groups in the chart are clustered around these four rates, which move from highest on the left to lowest on the right. The lower tax rates lead to more after-tax income for people in the top 1 percent and less adjusted revenue for the federal government. Other tax parameters don&rsquo;t have nearly as much effect on after-tax income for these high-income taxpayers.
        </p>
        <p class = "jumpTo">
        <span data-group = "a" data-income = "8">Jump to the Explore section</span> at the bottom to see how other tax policy parameters affect this group.
        </p>
        </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        So what does this all show about the TCJA&rsquo;s trade-offs? Compared with prior law, many plans would have generated more adjusted revenue than the TCJA while also increasing after-tax income for people in the first quintile.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        But many fewer plans would accomplish this for people in the top 1 percent of the income distribution.
        </p>
      </section>


      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Let&rsquo;s look again at plans that benefit after-tax income for lower-income people (or those in the first quintile).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        Among tax plans that don&rsquo;t lose any more revenue than the TCJA, plenty of plans increase after-tax income for people in more than one group. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Here we&rsquo;re looking at the overlap between plans that benefit the first quintile&rsquo;s after-tax income and plans that benefit the next-highest income group (or second quintile);
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        between the first, second, and third quintiles;
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        and between the first, second, third, and fourth quintiles.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        But this trend doesn&rsquo;t continue when we get to the highest-income taxpayers (the fifth quintile). Among plans that don&rsquo;t lose more revenue than TCJA, there is no overlap among plans that benefit the fifth quintile and those that benefit any other quintile. In other words, tax plans can&rsquo;t help the highest-income taxpayers while also helping the other income groups. 
        </p>
      </section>



      <section class="step smallStep penultimateStep">
        <p>
        All tax plans come with trade-offs for certain groups. Understanding these trade-offs, both in terms of revenue and people&rsquo;s after-tax income, is critical to creating sound, evidence-based tax policy. In our report, we look at a few alternative plans that would lose less adjusted revenue than the TCJA and more evenly distribute after-tax income.
        </p>
        <p>
        Below, see for yourself how changing tax policy parameters affects adjusted revenue and after-tax income for different groups.

We don&rsquo;t include the pre-TCJA values for the CTC refundability threshold or refundable portion because prior law had a different CTC amount, and therefore a different reference point, for those values.

                      Our adjusted revenue measure differs from a traditional revenue score from the Joint Committee on Taxation because we smooth results to avoid short-term fluctuations in income distributions caused by the timing of tax provisions. For example, we address the year-to-year fluctuations in distributions created by the timing of repatriation taxes by smoothing the effects of the provisions over eight years. For other corporate provisions, we reduce fluctuations in distributions by using the net present value of the change rather than the cash flow value. Although these methods provide a more consistent estimate of distributional effects, they distort the yearly changes in revenue. Additionally, our revenue estimates are based on a calendar year; Joint Committee on Taxation revenue estimates are produced in fiscal years.
