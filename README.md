# Exploring Alternatives to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

This repository contains the code behind a [data driven feature](https://apps.urban.org/features/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-alternatives/) published by the Tax Policy Center.

The visuals were built largely in [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3), with the scrollytelling framework built off of @vlandham 's [scroll-demo](https://github.com/vlandham/scroll_demo)
